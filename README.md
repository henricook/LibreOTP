# LibreOTP

LibreOTP is a cross-platform desktop OTP code generator that works with exported JSON files from [2FAS](https://2fas.com/). It supports Windows, Mac and Linux and 2FAS features like grouping. Both encrypted and unencrypted 2FAS exports are supported. Currently only TOTP keys are supported.

This project was borne from necessity. I needed a modern desktop application that would support 2FAS exports including grouping and search on Linux. It's rough, it's ready, but it does exactly what I needed it to do and might be what you need to!

Flutter means this app works on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Contributions and improvements are welcome, open an `RFC: ` issue if you'd like to discuss a plan before getting started.

## Installation

### Easy Installation (Recommended)

**üì¶ Debian/Ubuntu Linux**
```bash
# Download the .deb package from the latest release
wget https://github.com/henricook/LibreOTP/releases/latest/download/libreotp.deb
sudo dpkg -i libreotp.deb
```
The app will appear in your applications menu. Dependencies are automatically installed.

**üçé macOS**
1. Download the `.dmg` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/henricook/LibreOTP/releases/latest)
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag LibreOTP to your Applications folder
3. Launch from Applications or Spotlight

### Advanced Installation (Other Operating Systems)

**üêß Other Linux Distributions**
1. Download `libreotp-linux.tar.gz` from the [releases page](https://github.com/henricook/LibreOTP/releases)
2. Extract: `tar -xzf libreotp-linux.tar.gz`
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian - try one of these libjsoncpp versions (varies by Ubuntu version):
   sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libjsoncpp26  # Ubuntu 24.04+
   # OR
   sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libjsoncpp25  # Ubuntu 22.04, 23.04
   # OR  
   sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libjsoncpp1   # Older Ubuntu versions
   ```
4. Run: `chmod +x LibreOTP && ./LibreOTP`

**ü™ü Windows**
1. Download `libreotp-windows.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/henricook/LibreOTP/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder
3. Run `LibreOTP.exe`

## Getting Started

1. **Export your 2FAS data**: Generate an export from your 2FAS app and save it as `data.json`
   - Both encrypted and unencrypted exports are supported
   - For encrypted exports, you'll be prompted to enter your password when the app starts

2. **Import into LibreOTP**: Launch the app and use the import button to select your `data.json` file
   - The app will automatically detect if your export is encrypted
   - Your data is stored securely on your device

3. **Start generating codes**: Click any service to copy its OTP code to your clipboard

4. **Enjoy!** And don't forget to :star: Star the repository to encourage further updates. 

## Troubleshooting

### Linux: "Unable to generate build files" or secure storage not working
- If using the deb package: Dependencies should be automatically installed
- If using source/binary releases: Try installing the libjsoncpp version for your Ubuntu:
  - `sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libjsoncpp26` (Ubuntu 24.04+)
  - `sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libjsoncpp25` (Ubuntu 22.04/23.04)  
  - `sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libjsoncpp1` (older versions)
- For development/building: `sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev libjsoncpp-dev`
- **If secure storage compilation fails**: The app will automatically fall back to less secure storage and show a warning message

### "Password required for encrypted backup" error
- Your 2FAS export file is encrypted - this is normal and more secure
- Click "Enter Password" and provide the password you set when creating the export
- The password will be securely stored for future app launches

### Wrong password or decryption errors
- Verify you're using the correct password for your 2FAS export
- If you've forgotten the password, you'll need to create a new export from 2FAS
- Click "Use Different Password" to clear any stored password and try again

### Empty app or no services showing
- Check that your `data.json` file is in the correct location (see file paths above)
- Verify the file contains valid 2FAS export data
- For encrypted files, ensure you've entered the correct password

## Limitations
- Only supports 2FAS export format (not Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- HOTP (counter-based) codes are not yet supported
- File location is hardcoded - no file picker UI
- Linux: secure password storage requires additional system packages (falls back to less secure storage if unavailable)

## Building Deb Packages
1. Run `flutter build linux`
2. Move the contents of `build/linux/x64/release/bundle` to `deb/libreotp_VERSION/opt/libreotp/`
3. Update the version in `deb/libreotp_VERSION/DEBIAN/control` if needed
4. cd to deb/
5. Run `dpkg-deb --build libreotp_VERSION`, the deb appears in the same directory.
6. Install with `sudo dpkg -i libreotp_VERSION.deb`
   - Dependencies (libsecret-1-0, libjsoncpp1) will be automatically installed

## Credit

### [OTPClient](https://github.com/paolostivanin/OTPClient)

Core layout of the app is heavily inspired by `otpclient` which I liked but I found lacked grouping. Being written in C, I didn't find it particularly easy to contribute to either. 

### [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) 

The Flutter docs are great and along with IntelliJ's starter project meant I got up and running really fast.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Support for both encrypted and unencrypted 2FAS exports
- ‚úÖ Secure password storage with automatic decryption on subsequent launches
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ‚úÖ 2FAS group support and search functionality
- ‚úÖ TOTP code generation with copy-to-clipboard

## Roadmap / ideas

1. Support for HOTP (counter-based) codes
